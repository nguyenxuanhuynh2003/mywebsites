						<h2>About RMK</h2>
						<p>RMK Resourcing is an Asia based specialist legal search firm which partners with law firms, corporates and finan-cial institutions to find them the best possible lawyers for that institution’s specific needs. We build long term rela-tionships with both clients and candidates and pride ourselves on consistently placing the right lawyers with the right organisations whilst maintaining our culture of transparency, discretion and integrity. </p>
						<p>We understand that any hire you are looking to make, whether it’s a strategic team acquisition or simply building junior resource is critical to your business.  Similarly, we know that individual careers take years to build and that any potential move needs to be carefully considered and planned.   It’s this understanding that underpins everything we do at RMK Resourcing.  We strive to be regarded as your trusted advisor and we ensure that every project we take on receives partner level executive search service.</p>
						<p>When working with RMK Resourcing you will be dealing with consultants who have all spent time working within law firms.  We are able to combine our knowledge of the inner workings of the legal world with extensive legal re-cruitment experience to provide pragmatic and results-orientated solutions.<br> Whether you are actively looking to hire, move or simply interested in hearing more about the market, we’d love to speak with you. </p>

							<div class="container1">
								<h3>“There were two driving principles behind the de-cision to set up RMK Re-sourcing”</h3>
								<p><span>1.</span>I wanted to create an agency that offered part-ner level executive search quality services to all of our clients and candidates, whether they be mid-senior level associates, in-house counsel or partners</p>
								<p><span>2.</span>I wanted to create an agency of trusted advi-sors who build long term relationships with clients and candidates, not focusing on quick wins or forcing hires but acting as valued strategic partners for clients as they grow their bu-sinesses, and for candidates as they progress through their careers.”</p>
